Boating, fishing, swimming, walking, beachcombing, bird-watching, playing and sunbathing are among the common activities beachgoers enjoy. Beaches provide protection to residents living near the ocean by acting as a buffer against the high winds and waves of powerful storms or rough seas. However, pollution at the beach can result in swimmers getting sick or temporary beach closures that negatively affect the local economy. In addition, overuse by visitors can damage sensitive habitats, such as beach dunes, and create marine debris. The good news is that we can all help protect our beaches and our health.</td>
